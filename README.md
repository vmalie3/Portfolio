## Description

I've attempted to create a Portfolio website. I have a navigation bar for the about me, work, and contact me sections, along with a fooder link that will return to the top of the page. I included a picture and short about me paragraph. 


I included images of past work along with place holder images with captions and links (one functional, some placeholder). I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out flex box and have made a tutoring appointment to help me improve the styling and layout of this website.

At the bottom, I included a contact me section with links to my email, LinkedIn and GitHub.
